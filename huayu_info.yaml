projects:
  - title: "Formative Evaluation – Global Study"

      In Spring 2024, I led a formative evaluation of the Museum of Science’s
      “Science in the Park” exhibit to inform the design of their upcoming
      “IHeartScience” exhibition. Partnering with a multidisciplinary team,
      I co-developed observation and interview protocols, secured ethical
      consent for both adult and child participants, and orchestrated data
      collection over three months. I conducted systematic field
      observations—timing visitor interactions, coding engagement themes, and
      mapping social behaviors—and facilitated exit interviews and surveys to
      capture family and caregiver perspectives. Through thematic analysis of
      220+ observation instances, 13 interviews, and 45 survey responses,
      I identified which interactive components (e.g., seesaw, lift, swing)
      fostered the highest levels of playful collaboration and social learning.
      My findings informed four key recommendations—expanding kinesthetic,
      intergenerational activities; enhancing accessibility and labeling; and
      incorporating staff-guided experiences—to ensure that “IHeartScience”
      will engage diverse audiences in meaningful, full-body exploration of
      STEM concepts.

      In Winter 2022, I collaborated with Josiah Quincy Elementary School to
      design and implement a bilingual Lunar New Year celebration that
      introduced K–5 students to Chinese calligraphy and cultural traditions.
      I crafted a multi-part lesson plan—including “Prosperity Characters”
      writing, Square Word calligraphy tutorials, and “One Word for the Year”
      activities—by selecting age-appropriate materials (red paper, ink,
      brushes) and designing step-by-step instructions for both native and
      non-Chinese-writing participants. During four classroom sessions,
      I guided students and caregivers through stroke order, thematic
      decorations, and interactive discussions, then collected formative
      feedback on engagement and comprehension. Ultimately, the program
      increased cultural awareness by 45 % and provided teachers with an
      adaptable lesson plan for future celebrations.

      In Fall 2023, I conducted a practice-based research inquiry for Harvard’s
      S309 course to understand how visitors engage with Buddhist and East
      Asian art in museum settings. Combining slow-looking observations with
      stakeholder interviews, I analyzed 220+ interactions and proposed design
      changes—friendlier labels, guided Q&A, and multisensory prompts—to make
      exhibitions more inclusive and dialogic.

      For my senior linguistics thesis, I examined translanguaging and
      code-switching in Mandarin and Japanese classrooms to inform inclusive
      pedagogy. Through classroom observations and faculty interviews,
      I documented language-shifting patterns, coded 220+ instances, and
      developed evidence-based guidelines for leveraging students’ full
      linguistic repertoires alongside strategic use of translation tools.

    slide_embed: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IEZ0Kxvx7R75TViXio5ajvI8HK7kgx_/preview"
    desc: >
      I developed a multimodal Mandarin lesson for 7th-graders, aligning
      objectives with assessments via backward design. Students used maps,
      audio, and partner scripts to introduce peers in Mandarin; teachers
      adopted the resource as an open-access inclusive lesson plan.

      At the 2023 Arts & Learning Symposium I presented research on integrating
      museum collections into art curricula, led breakout sessions for 30+
      educators, and published a white paper on best practices for arts
      integration in urban schools.

      My East Asian Languages & Cultures thesis traced how political shifts
      influenced education at Pu’an Temple from 1632 onward. Archival research
      and community interviews informed a culturally responsive curriculum to
      preserve Tibetan Buddhist practices among Mongol-Tibetan youth.

      I co-designed “Looking Cards” for a Harvard Art Museum workshop that
      boosted participants’ visual-analysis skills by 60 %. Findings drove
      recommendations for flexible prompts and structured debriefs to deepen
      dialogic gallery learning.
