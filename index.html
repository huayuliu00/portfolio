        <h3>Formative Evaluation – Global Study</h3>
        <p>In Spring 2024, I led a formative evaluation of the Museum of Science's "Science in the Park" exhibit to inform the
        design of their upcoming "IHeartScience" exhibition. Partnering with a multidisciplinary team, I co-developed
        observation and interview protocols, secured ethical consent for both adult and child participants, and
        orchestrated data collection over three months. I conducted systematic field observations—timing visitor
        interactions, coding engagement themes, and mapping social behaviors—and facilitated exit interviews and surveys
        to capture family and caregiver perspectives. Through thematic analysis of 20 observation instances, 13
        interviews, and 45 survey responses, I identified which interactive components (e.g., seesaw, lift, swing)
        fostered the highest levels of playful collaboration and social learning. My findings informed four key
        recommendations—expanding kinesthetic, intergenerational activities; enhancing accessibility and labeling; and
        incorporating staff-guided experiences—to ensure that "IHeartScience" will engage diverse audiences in
        meaningful, full-body exploration of STEM concepts.</p>

        <h3>Lunar New Year Celebration: Museum of Fine Arts x Josiah Quincy Elementary School</h3>
        <p>In February 2025, I collaborated with Josiah Quincy Elementary School to
          design and implement a bilingual Lunar New Year celebration that
          introduced K–5 students to Chinese calligraphy and cultural traditions.
          I crafted a multi-part lesson plan—including "Prosperity Characters"
          writing, Xu Bin's Square Word calligraphy tutorials (for non-native Chinese participants), and "One Word for the Year"
          activities—by selecting age-appropriate materials (red paper, ink,
          brushes) and designing step-by-step instructions for both native and
          non-Chinese-writing participants. Here's feedback on behalf of the School Community Council: "The event was a huge success, with over 350 attendees, and your activity was truly one of the highlights of the night! Families were so excited that the MFA was there to lead them through the experience, and we literally couldn't get kids to leave at the end—that's how much they loved it! It was such a pleasure working with you and your team, and we are incredibly grateful for your partnership."

        <h3>Practice-based Research in Art Learning: Understanding Visitor Engagement with Buddhist Art in Museums</h3>
        <p>In Fall 2023, I conducted a practice-based research inquiry for Harvard's Practice-based Research in Art Learning: Understanding Visitor Engagement with Buddhist Art in Museums course to 
           how visitors engage with Buddhist and East
      Asian art in museum settings. Combining slow-looking observations with
      stakeholder interviews, I analyzed visitors interactions and proposed design
      changes—friendlier labels, guided Q&A, and multisensory prompts—to make
      exhibitions more inclusive and dialogic.

        <h3>Linguistics Thesis Defense (May 5 2023)</h3>
        <p>In Spring 2023, I conducted my senior Linguistics thesis on the use of translanguaging and code-switching in
        Mandarin and Japanese language classrooms to inform more inclusive foreign-language pedagogy. I designed a
        mixed-methods study—interviewing four professors (two Mandarin, two Japanese) and observing classroom
        interactions—to document when and why instructors shifted languages, how these practices aligned with
        institutional hierarchies, and professors' attitudes toward machine-translation tools. By coding observation
        instances and synthesizing insights from semi-structured interviews, I uncovered how targeted translanguaging
        strategies support scaffolding complex grammar and facilitate deeper comprehension for emergent bilinguals. My
        analysis led to evidence-based guidelines recommending a balanced integration of students' full linguistic
        repertoires, strategic use of English as metalanguage only when necessary, and thoughtful incorporation of
        translation software to bolster learner autonomy. These findings equip language instructors with practical,
        research-backed techniques to design multilingual classrooms that honor student diversity and promote equitable
        access to the target language.</p>

        <h3>Lesson Plan – Multimodal Literacy (Nov 2022)</h3>
        <p>In Fall 2022, I designed and implemented a culturally responsive middle-school Mandarin lesson—"Introductory
        Chinese"—using Understanding by Design principles to celebrate classroom diversity and support emergent
        bilinguals. Drawing on pre-lesson surveys, I mapped students' home countries and incorporated Pashto, Arabic, and
        Spanish translations alongside Chinese vocabulary to ensure universal access. My backwards-planned objectives
        guided partner-based activities in which students practiced self-introduction scripts ("我来自___") both orally and
        visually, locating their home countries on a world map handout. Throughout the lesson, formative checks
        (thumbs-up/thumbs-down slides and circulating observations) helped me gauge comprehension, and I adapted pacing
        when tone and pronunciation challenges arose under pandemic masking. By the end, every student confidently
        introduced a peer in Mandarin, and teachers received a replicable, multimodal framework—including slides,
        handouts, and reflection prompts—to extend inclusive practices for future language instruction.</p>

        <h3>Art & Learning Symposium Presentation (Mar 25 2023)</h3>
        <p>In Spring 2024, I collaborated with Project Zero's Art/Play team to design and evaluate a "Natural Materials"
        workshop for early childhood educators. Over six weeks, I co-developed interview protocols, transcribed and coded
        interviews with six PreK teachers and three cultural organization partners, and synthesized themes into an
        Art/Play codebook. I then helped organize and facilitate a hands-on professional development session—guiding
        20+ PreK teachers, BPS curriculum designers, and community artists through kinesthetic activities that explored
        natural materials as learning catalysts. Throughout the workshop, I conducted field observations (photographing
        interactions, collecting participant reflections, and mapping engagement patterns) and logged artifacts into a
        shared repository. My mixed-methods analysis revealed that incorporating open-ended, nature-based prompts
        significantly enhanced teacher confidence in facilitating emergent, inquiry-driven play and led to three
        evidence-based recommendations: embed more scaffolding tools (e.g., visual storyboards), create modular lesson
        templates for diverse classroom contexts, and develop a digital facilitator guide to support iterative
        refinement.</p>

        <h3>EALC Thesis Presentation (Dec 5 2022)</h3>
        <p>In Fall 2022, for my East Asian Languages and Cultures thesis at Bryn Mawr College, I examined how legal and
        political forces—from Qing-era edicts to modern SARA regulations and Japanese imperial policies—have shaped
        educational practices at Pu'an Temple in northeastern China. I conducted archival research using the Pu'an
        Temple Manuscript and historical gazetteers, collected primary data through semi-structured interviews with local
        monks and community elders, and performed thematic coding of documents and transcripts to trace the abbot's
        reincarnation lineage from 1632 to the present. By mapping regulatory shifts against changes in monastic
        instruction, ritual training, and community outreach, I identified key factors that influenced how Tibetan
        Buddhist teachings were transmitted, adapted, or suppressed. Based on these findings, I designed a culturally
        responsive instructional framework that integrates historical context, doctrinal lineage, and participatory
        learning activities—creating a pilot curriculum model aimed at heritage education programs to preserve Tibetan
        Buddhist practices among Mongol-Tibetan youth.</p>

        <h3>Slow Looking – Inquiry Workshop</h3>
        <p>In January 2024, I co-designed and facilitated a "Slow Looking" inquiry experience at the Harvard Art Museum as
        part of an art and learning course, where our team created and iteratively refined a set of "Looking Cards" to
        guide visitors through reflective engagement with artworks. I led materials prototyping—selecting card prompts,
        testing various sizes, and drafting accompanying handouts—and collaborated with two instructors to onboard eight
        invited participants aged 23–30. During the 40-minute session, I observed individuals engaging with prompts
        (e.g., "find something that represents freedom"), guided small-group discussions, and collected qualitative
        feedback through field notes and participant reflections posted on a Padlet board. Analyzing 20 observation
        instances and pre/post reflections, I identified that the cards effectively slowed visitors' pacing, encouraged
        deeper connections between artworks, and scaffolded the development of personalized meaning. My analysis
        informed three key recommendations for museum educators: incorporate scaffolded prompts to foster inquiry, design
        flexible reflective tools that accommodate diverse perspectives, and create structured debrief sessions to deepen
        dialogic learning in gallery settings.</p>
